# Remit

Remit is a payment file gateway. Clients drop CSV payment batch files on an SFTP server; `intake-service` picks them up, validates every payment instruction with Spring Batch, and publishes valid instructions to Kafka. `routing-service` consumes those instructions idempotently and routes each one to a payment channel (EFT, WIRE, INTERAC), dead-lettering failures after retries. `api-service` gives operators a JWT-secured REST API to monitor batches, inspect rejected rows, and replay dead-lettered messages, and it writes every state change to an append-only audit trail in MongoDB. No real money moves and no real bank is involved: channel limits and rules are illustrative.

Each service owns its own MySQL schema (`remit_intake`, `remit_routing`, `remit_api`) and never reads another service's data; everything crosses service boundaries as a Kafka event. See [ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-service-boundaries.md).

## Stack

- Java 17, Spring Boot 3 (3.5.x), Maven multi-module build
- Spring Web, Spring Security (JWT, role-based endpoints)
- Spring Batch for file ingestion
- Spring Data JPA / Hibernate on MySQL 8, Flyway migrations
- Apache Kafka 3 (KRaft) with Spring Kafka
- MongoDB 7 for the audit trail
- SFTP (atmoz/sftp) as the file drop zone
- Docker and Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests (kustomize)
- Bash ops scripts
- Jenkins pipeline with JUnit, Postman/Newman and SonarQube
- JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ, Testcontainers; JaCoCo coverage gate and Spotless (google-java-format)

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `remit-common/` | Shared event records, enums, topic names, masking utilities |
| `intake-service/` | SFTP polling and the Spring Batch ingestion job |
| `routing-service/` | Idempotent Kafka consumer and channel routing |
| `api-service/` | Operator REST API, security, read model, audit writer |
| `docs/decisions/` | Architecture decision records |

## Build

Requires JDK 17. The Maven wrapper downloads Maven 3.9.9 on first use.

```bash
./mvnw -B verify          # compile, unit + integration tests, Spotless check, JaCoCo gate
./mvnw -B spotless:apply  # reformat Java sources with google-java-format
./mvnw -B -Powasp verify  # optional OWASP dependency report (target/dependency-check-report.html)
```

The JaCoCo check fails any module whose line coverage drops below 80%.

## Quick start

Coming in a later milestone.
